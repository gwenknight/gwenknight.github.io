## Research themes

My research is united by the use of mathematical modelling to tackle the spread of antibacterial resistance (AbR), and now SARS-CoV-2. I am interested in using cutting-edge quantitative methods to explore the many dimensions of AbR from it's basic genetic evolution, to environmental selection to informing the design of interventions for control. Using this experience of thinking about the sources of AbR, I am now trying to help with the understanding of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and similarly, interventions for control. 

### COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally affected the way we do research, and for many mathematical modellers of infectious disease, the questions we now need to ask. My research on COVID-19 has taken two main paths: one was to provide support for UCLH to calculate bed occupancy during the London outbreak in the Spring of 2020. This has led to research into the length of stay of patients with COVID-19. 

Secondly, I've been looking into the spread of SARS-CoV-2 - which settings are associated with transmission? This has led me to focus now on hospital environments. We now have a grant to look specifically at heteogeneity between Trusts and interventions to control.

### Fitness costs to resistance

The acquisition of a resistance phenotype often comes with a "fitness
cost" to the host. Determining the size of this "cost" and its impact on
the natural history of an infection is key to developing accurate
mathematical models of infectious disease spread. My research uses both experimental methods, such as those utilised in my PhD for the bacterium *Staphylococcus aureus*, and mathematical modelling tools for *in situ* data to estimate fitness costs.

### Tackling antibiotic resistance in UK hospitals

I believe mathematical modelling has a key place in informing and guiding interventions for antibiotic reistance and infection control in hospitals. By developing models, fit to hospital data, new interventions as well as hypotheses about resistance development can be developed. I work closely with a number of UK hospitals to align my research questions with clinical need and parametrise them as far as possible with existing clinical data. Currently, I am working on SNP cut-offs for MRSA isolates for genome screening in hospitals and transmission differentials between hospital wards. 

Carbapenem resistance is a growing problem across the UK, with increasing numbers of proportions of infections being reported as
resistant to this last line antibiotic. My MRC fellowship aims to explore the reasons for the variation in carbapenem resistance across
England and to use the results to target interventions for control.

### *Selected publications*
[Screening for carbapenem resistance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6094916/). This work explores whether screening for patients carrying carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae should be done using a direct PCR test or a culture and then PCR combination. This was presented at ECCMID 2018.

### Where does antibiotic resistance come from? 

A fundamental aspect to AbR control is understanding where the AbR bacteria are selected for and transmitted from. We are interested in reducing the number of infections in humans with AbR bacteria. If most of this resistance is selected by antibiotic use in the community then we should reduce antibiotic use in primary care. If most was initially selected for in pigs, then we need to target antibiotic use and then onward transmission from pork products. These maps of selection and transmission are likely to vary by organism and resistance mechanism, but until they are mapped and more importantly, quantified (which is most important) we will be merely fire-fighting the end problem of AbR. My research here develops mathematical models and frameworks to assess the importance of different environments in different settings (e.g. UK vs. Niger) and then their contribution to the economic burden.

### Heterogeneity in antimicrobial resistance

Bacterial populations are highly heterogeneous, with variation in both
underlying growth abilities and resistance levels (reflected by varying
minimum inhibitory concentrations or MICs). However, this variation is
often missing from mathematical models that aim to capture the dynamics
of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) spread or interventions for AMR
control. In this aspect of my research, I am working to develop a new modelling
framework to better understand the underlying dynamics and to improve
treatment design to prevent AMR emergence.

### TB Vaccines

I also have a long-term interest in the development and impact of new TB vaccines for TB control, continued from my postdoc work at LSHTM. This has two strands. Firstly, using population models to assess the impact of potential new vaccines on TB incidence and secondly, the development of a new framework for vaccine dosing in general that was stimulated by initial quantitative analysis of TB vaccine dosing. The latter will be, I believe, highly important for vaccine design in the future as we move towards something like the quantitative PK/PD framework employed by drug dosing.
