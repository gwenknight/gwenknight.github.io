COVID-19 has made meeting up regularly difficult and working from home is isolating. So a group of us meet every other week for FortKnight where we have a two presentations: one of us presents a piece of their own work, one of us presents an interesting report / presentation. Check out my Twitter feed for examples of our interesting discussions. We are currently 6 people in "KnightGroup".
