### MRC Skills Development Fellowship: 

#### Title: The dynamics of drug resistance within hospital populations of Gram-negative bacteria

**Funder** [MRC](https://www.mrc.ac.uk/skills-careers/fellowships/skills-development-fellowships/)

I have a 3 year Skills Development fellowship (2017-2020) to construct mathematical models of drug resistance. 

My collaborators are from Imperial College London ([Alison Holmes](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/alison.holmes)), PHE ([Julie Robotham](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/j.robotham), [Susan Hopkins](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.hopkins), [Alan
Johnson](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.johnson)), Uppsala University ([Dan Andersson](http://www.imbim.uu.se/Research/Microbiology-immunology/Andersson_Dan_I/)), and my mentor at LSHTM is [Graham Medley](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/medley.graham).


### MACOTRA

#### Aim: To increase our understanding of transmission success to better control MRSA

**Funder** EU funded Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance [JPIAMR](https://www.jpiamr.eu/supportedprojects/third-joint-callresult/)

I have funding for a 6month postdoc to explore the reasons for clonal dynamics in MRSA (Anneke de Vos). 

I am a collaborator on this grant which is lead by [Margreet Vos](http://www.safety-and-security.nl/people/profdr-margreet-vos) at
Erasmus University Medical Center. Other collaborators include [Jodi Lindsay](https://www.sgul.ac.uk/research-profiles-a-z/jodi-lindsay) at St George's, University of London, the University of Lyon and the Dutch National Institute for public health and environment.

### Modeling Infectious Diseases in Healthcare Network (MIND-Healthcare)

#### Aims: To investigate similarities and differences in interventions for carbapenem resistance control between the UK and USA and to develop new models of carbapenem resistance spread

**Funder** CDC through the [MIND-Healthcare Network](https://www.cdc.gov/hai/research/MIND-Healthcare.html)

We have funding for a 1.5yr postdoc to analyse data and construct models of CRE spread (Andrea Weisse).

I am now an external collaborator on this grant, awarded whilst I was at Imperial College London, lead by [Eili Klein](http://www.cddep.org/profile/eili_klein#sthash.wyshtNcw.dpbs) at the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy. Other collaborators
include Imperial College London ([Alison Holmes](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/alison.holmes)), Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, MathEcology, University of Maryland.

### Vaccines and MDR-TB

#### Aim: To estimate the heath impact, cost-effectiveness and budget impact of novel TB vaccines on MDR-TB

**Funder** AERAS

I am consulting on this project lead by [Richard White](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/white.richard).

### Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH)

#### Aims: To develop a framework for intervention assessment for AMR across One Health

**Funder** [Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research](https://www.cgiar.org/)

We have funding for a 2 year postdoc to construct the framework (Nichola Naylor). 

This collaboration is led by Jeff Waage and [Jo Lines](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/lines.jo).
