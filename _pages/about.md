I am an Assistant Professor at the [London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/knight.gwen),
funded to work on the spread of antimicrobial resistance by an [MRC
Skills Development
Fellowship](https://www.mrc.ac.uk/skills-careers/fellowships/).

My [research](https://gwenknight.github.io/research/) uses
mathematical modelling to better understand the spread of pathogens, with a particular focus on antibacterial resistance.

In antibiotic resistance, I an interested in capturing bacterial heterogeneity and its influence on AMR development. I work mainly with the pathogens methicillin resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).

I am also intersted in *where* transmission and selection occurs. This has become increasingly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. I've worked on this exploring settings of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by looking for open access reported clusters and am now focused on the contribution of the hospital environment to ongoing spread. 

I previously worked at the NIHR funded
[HPRU](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/hpru-amr) for Healthcare
Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance at Imperial College
London. Before that I was a postdoc with the [TB Modelling
group](http://tbmodelling.lshtm.ac.uk/) at LSHTM.
