## Research themes

My research is united by the use of mathematical modelling to tackle the spread of antibacterial resistance (AbR). I am interested in using cutting-edge quantitative methods to explore the many dimensions of AbR from it's basic genetic evolution, to environmental selection to informing the design of interventions for control.

### Fitness costs to resistance

The acquisition of a resistance phenotype often comes with a "fitness
cost" to the host. Determining the size of this "cost" and its impact on
the natural history of an infection is key to developing accurate
mathematical models of infectious disease spread. My research uses both experimental methods, such as those utilised in my PhD for the bacterium *Staphylococcus aureus*, and mathematical modelling tools for *in situ* data to estimate fitness costs. 

#### Selected publications
[Fitness costs in TB](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsif.2018.0025): We estimated the fitness costs to multi-drug resistance carriage in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* in Peru to be substantial from detailed *in situ* data.

[Differences in fitness between MRSA clones](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22761331): Using hospital strains of *S. aureus* we explored what may have caused a decline in MRSA incidence at St. George's University NHS Trust and found a fitness differential between the key clonal complexes.

### Tackling antibiotic resistance in UK hospitals

I believe mathematical modelling has a key place in informing and guiding interventions for antibiotic reistance and infection control in hospitals. By developing models, fit to hospital data, new interventions as well as hypotheses about resistance development can be developed. I work closely with a number of UK hospitals to align my research questions with clinical need and parametrise them as far as possible with existing clinical data. 

Carbapenem resistance is a growing problem across the UK, with increasing numbers of proportions of infections being reported as
resistant to this last line antibiotic. My MRC fellowship aims to explore the reasons for the variation in carbapenem resistance across
England and to use the results to target interventions for control.

#### Selected publications
[Screening for carbapenem resistance](). This work explores whether screening for patients carrying carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae should be done using a direct PCR test or a culture and then PCR combination. This was presented at ECCMID 2018.

### Where does antibiotic resistance come from? 

A fundamental 


### Heterogeneity in antimicrobial resistance

Bacterial populations are highly heterogeneous, with variation in both
underlying growth abilities and resistance levels (reflected by varying
minimum inhibitory concentrations or MICs). However, this variation is
often missing from mathematical models that aim to capture the dynamics
of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) spread or interventions for AMR
control. In this aspect of my research, I am working to develop a new modelling
framework to better understand the underlying dynamics and to improve
treatment design to prevent AMR emergence. 

### Selected publications 
[Variation in fitness in *M.tb*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4583567/): We showed the importance of variation in fitness to the future levels of MDR-TB.
