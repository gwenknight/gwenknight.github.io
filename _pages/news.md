### April 2019: Gwen leads winning team of Wellcome Data Re-Use Prize

Gwen, Nichola and Quentin were all involved in the LSHTM AR.IA team that won the Wellcome Data Re-Use Prize on AMR. We developed a syndrome-level composite index to guide empiric therapy decisions using a new large open access Pfizer database on bacterial resistance provided by Wellcome for this prize. For more information check out our [report](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn18201040/wiki/588540) and the Shiny [app](https://gwenknight.shinyapps.io/empiric_prescribing/) we developed, or see the writeup in the [LSHTM AMR Centre newsletter](https://us14.campaign-archive.com/?u=df3850780881af5c9b292f260&id=22095d320b). 

### October 2018: Quentin starts his PhD

Quentin Leclerc has started his [MRC LID PhD](http://mrc-lid.lshtm.ac.uk/studentshipcohort/) with Gwen and Jodi Lindsay to explore the dynamics of horizontal gene transfer in *Staphylococcus aureus*. From a background of microbiology, he has trained in mathematical modelling at Imperial College London and will be using a combination of wet and computational methods to explore the importance of bacteriophage and transduction to AMR spread. 

### August 2018: Nichola Naylor joins LSHTM

Nichola Naylor has joined LSHTM to work on a One Health collaboration between LSHTM and the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) called ‘Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH)’, funded by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. An economist by training, Nichola will be applying her quantitative skills to explore how we can assess the economic impact of cross-disciplinary interventions to control AMR.
